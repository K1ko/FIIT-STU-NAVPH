# The Echo Spire

**The Echo Spire** is a 2D atmospheric platformer with roguelite progression, developed in **Unity for PC as a part of Game Development Course at FIIT STU**.
You play as **Errant**, a lost soul trapped within a living tower that feeds on memories, regrets, and fragments of a broken mind.

Each ascent through the Spire reveals distorted memories, challenges your precision platforming skills, and slowly uncovers the truth behind Errant’s past.
